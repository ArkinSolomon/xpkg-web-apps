# X-Pkg Developers

This section of the documentation is for contributors to X-Pkg software (such as the client or registry), as well as third-party application developers. It explains high-level systems and how things work under the hood. If you are seeking to publish to the X-Pkg registry see [the package developer documentation](/package-developers.md).
