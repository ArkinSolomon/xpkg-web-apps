# X-Pkg Registry API

This section of the documentation explains the different routes of the REST API for the X-Pkg registry, including request parameters, sample responses, and rate limits. The API is publicly accessible for anyone to create their own apps to read and write data from the registry. In some cases, understanding of the [package developer documentation](/package-developers) and/or the [X-Pkg developer documentation](/xpkg-developers) may be required.
