# X-Pkg Web Application

Archived source code for all X-Pkg services and web-applications.

## Archived 

This project has been archived due to the announcemnt of the X-Plane store. See [my project post](https://arkinsolomon.net/projects) for more details.

## Other Repositories

The [X-Pkg Client](https://github.com/ArkinSolomon/xpkg-client) was used to actually install the packages on the user's machine.

Although Sakura was intentionally created for this project, the [Java Sakura Interpreter](https://github.com/ArkinSolomon/sakura-interpreter-java) remains unarchived, as it may one day be updated. This includes the [Sakura Documentation](https://sakura-docs.arkinsolomon.net) and its [repository](https://github.com/ArkinSolomon/sakura-interpreter-java).
